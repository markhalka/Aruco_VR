Currently the software only works on Windows and Android, however, future implementations with ios and iPhone will be available soon.

Multiple sample Aruco marker images can be found in the bin folder, however, these can be customized, generated and printed from the downloadable software. 

There are included instructions in the downloadable app; however, a general overview is available below:
1. First the user must place aruco markers around the room, if this is already done this step can be skipped.
2. Next, the user must open the app on their computer, and on their phone, after which they will automatically connect.
3. The user will be prompted to initialize the room if it has not yet been done. If not then they will simply need to point the camera at each marker in the room.
4. Next, the user will be asked to initialize the camera of the phone if it has not yet been done. If not, they will need to point the camera at multiple angles at the designated calibration board.
5. Once these are complete, the user can place the phone in the headset, and begin playing their chosen game.
